[General]
; DasmTypes is a comma-seperated list of the named Disassembly types.
; Disassembly type names must not contain embedded spaces.
; Each comma seperated Disassembly type name must have an INI section of the same name created below.
; A maximum of 8 Disassembly type names are currently supported.
; Each included type adds to HxD load time, as the definition files are parsed on DLL initialization.
; If HxD load time is an issue, only include the actual DasmTypes that you currently require. :)       
DasmTypes=6502,65C02,W65C02S,65C816,6800,6809

; NOTES:
; Each DasmType type name also defines the Disassembly name that will appear in the HxD DataInspector grid.
; ie. In the form: "Disassembly (DasmType)", where the Disassembly word itself is automatically localized.  
; The function of each individual setting is documented in the first type name INI section below.

[6502]
; MaxInstructionByteCount specifies the largest single instruction byte sequence for this type.
; ie. This represents the largest valid combined length of OpcodeBytes + OperandBytes.
; Default=1
MaxInstructionByteCount=3

; OperandEndianness is a value (Big|Little) which defines the Endianess of the OperandBytes.
; For example, Motorola 68xx processors are Big Endian, whereas 6502 and many others are Little Endian. 
; Big Endian means the first Byte (lowest address) is treated as the most significant byte.
; Little Endian means  the first Byte (lowest address) is treated as the least significant byte.
; Default=Little
OperandEndianness=Little

; FirstOperandWildcard defines the character(s) in the CSV AssemblyString, that are to substituted with 
; any extracted FirstOperand argument (based on the OperandBytes & FirstOperandMask). 
; Default=?
FirstOperandWildcard=?

; SecondOperandWildcard defines the character(s) in the CSV AssemblyString, that are to substituted with 
; any extracted SecondOperand argument (based on the OperandBytes & SecondOperandMask). 
; Default=^
SecondOperandWildcard=^

; DefinitionFileName specifies the full .csv filename for the instruction defintions CSV file.
; This file would typically be located in the HxD 'Plugins' folder along with this .ini file (and .dll).
; However DefinitionFilePath can be used to locate the .csv file elsewhere, if you prefer. 
DefinitionFilePath=Plugins
DefinitionFileName=Dasm6502.csv

; DefinitionLogEnable is a boolean value (1|0) to specify if we want to create a log during the
; parsing of the Definition File.
; NOTE: Logging should only be enabled for verifying any Definition File changes, then disabled again. 
; Enabling logging can significantly increase HxD load time, as the log is written to disk.
DefinitionLogEnable=0

; DefinitionLogPath specifies the folder path (location) to where any log file is to be created.
; This parameter is only valid if DefinitionLogEnable is enabled (1). 
; Note the log file itself will be created using the same name as the DefinitionFileName, but 
; with a .log file extension.
; The log file is overwritten / re-generated on each parse of the DefinitionFile.
; The path specified should be a location with appropriate file creation/write authority,
; therefore the HxD Plugins folder is not recommended. An example is your system's Temp folder.    
DefinitionLogPath=C:\Temp
