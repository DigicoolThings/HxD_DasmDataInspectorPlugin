[General]
;DasmTypes is a comma seperated list of the named Disassembly types.
;Disassembly type names must not contain embedded spaces.
;Each comma seperated Disassembly type name must have an INI section of the same name created below.
;NOTE: A maximum of 8 Disassembly type names are currently supported.    
DasmTypes=6800,6809

; NOTE:
; The purpose of each individual setting is documented in the first type name INI section below.

[6800]
; Name is the descriptive name that will appear in the Data Inspector table.
Name=Disassembly (6800)
; MaxInstructionByteCount specifies the largest single instruction byte sequence for this type.
; ie. This represents the largest valid combined length of OpcodeBytes + OperandBytes.
; Default=1
MaxInstructionByteCount=3
; OperandEndianness is a value (Big|Little) which defines the Endianess of the OperandBytes.
; For example, Motorola 68xx processors are Big Endian, whereas Intel x86 is Little Endian. 
; Default=Little
OperandEndianness=Big
; ArgumentWildcard defines the character(s) in the CSV DasmStr, that are to substituted with 
; any extracted Argument (based on the OperandBytes & OperandArgumentMask). 
; Default=?
ArgumentWildcard=?
; DefinitionFileName specifies the full .csv filename for the instruction defintions CSV file.
; This file should be located in the HxD Plugins folder along with this .ini file (and the .dll). 
DefinitionFilePath=Plugins
DefinitionFileName=Dasm6800.csv
; DefinitionLogEnable is a boolean value (1|0) to specify if we want to create a log during the
; parsing of the Definition File. 
DefinitionLogEnable=0
; TypeDefinitionLogPath specifies the folder path (location) to where the log file should be created.
; This parameter is only valid if DefinitionLogFile is enabled (1). 
; Note the log file itself will be created using the same name as the DefinitionFileName, but 
; with a .log file extension.
; The log file is overwritten / re-generated on each parse of the DefinitionFile.  
DefinitionLogPath=C:\Temp

Name=Disassembly (6809)

OperandEndianness=Big
